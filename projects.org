* Self-balancing bike concept

Requirements for a battery balancing device:
1. Compact.
2. Fits in an Aptera body.
3. Maximal weight distribution.
4. Rapid delta.
5. Minimal flexing of wires.

Types:
1. Cartesian: battery is linearly actuated along an axis.
2. Polar: battery is rotated about an axis.
3. Polar+Cartesian: Vertically oriented battery can translate linearly or rotate along an axis.
4. Non-linear: Each battery module has two wheels

Cartesian: battery sits on a rail that is also the electrical coupling.
