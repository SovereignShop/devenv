SCHEDULED: <2022-03-23 Wed>
Design for molds and use smooth contours to minimize weak points.

1. [X] Parameterize components
2. [X] Redesign nozzle
3. [ ] Redesign mixer
  We want to redesign the mixer in a way that shares
  structure with the nozzle. The radius of the spiral
  should correspond to the radius of the nozzle at every z.

  Approaches:
   1. sample radius at each z.
   2. Subtraction

Encountering issues making the mixer mold. We're making a two-sided
mold. For the helix segments, there's only one way to align them, but
it's not clear how to align the base in this fashion.

The solution is to make the outward expanding section not sprialize,
then do a half turn, then do alternating 180 turns.
