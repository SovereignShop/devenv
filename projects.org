Try to use [[https://github.com/kitsunyan/xdg-open-server][xdg-open-server]] to open links in host.

Conclusion: not immediately feasible. WSL2 is a strange beast.

Found out WSL2 also does not support systemd natively. This is also not worth worrying about.
The above fix for time in container is satisfactory for now.
