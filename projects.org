Some tests work, cursor position is probably not properly maintained.
** TODO Exhaustive Tests of ~insert-chars~ :editor:
SCHEDULED: <2021-03-27 Sat>
Write more exhaustive tests of ~insert-chars~. The function
will probably need to be re-written.
** TODO Move editor into separate repository :editor:
SCHEDULED: <2021-03-30 Tue>
** TODO Implement delete-text :editor:
** TODO Add emacs as backend for editor :editor:
SCHEDULED: <2021-04-03 Sat>
Supporting emacs might be easy and will make it easier to develop and test.

Frames correspond to full chrome frames (headless).
** TODO Implement Windows
SCHEDULED: <2021-03-28 Sun>
*** Windows are movable within the current frame.
** TODO Data Model Spec
SCHEDULED: <2021-03-29 Mon>
Capture current semantics in a Spec using Spec or Malli.
** TODO Rename
SCHEDULED: <2021-03-31 Wed>
Swig is already a popular library. I need to come up with
a new name.

Try to use [[https://github.com/kitsunyan/xdg-open-server][xdg-open-server]] to open links in host.

Conclusion: not immediately feasible. WSL2 is a strange beast.

Found out WSL2 also does not support systemd natively. This is also not worth worrying about.
The above fix for time in container is satisfactory for now.
