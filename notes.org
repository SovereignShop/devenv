** [2021-03-15 Mon] Advice about working on first game

https://boardgamedesigncourse.com/advice-i-wish-i-had-when-i-was-working-on-my-first-game/

Take Away:

- Share your idea
- Show it to people! (feedback)
- playtesters!
- Work *consistently*!
- Don't worry about the first game!
  + This may mean that your first game is just an expansion or knockoff of an existing game.
  + It's good to have a portfolio demonstrating progression anyway

From the comments:
- Know why you are making the game.
  + Should we be trying to make money? Why not exactly?
