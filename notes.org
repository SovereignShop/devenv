** [2021-03-15 Mon] Setting expectations: A timeline
There's a rambly but maybe interesting discussion [[https://brandonthegamedev.com/lets-set-expectations-time-money-effort/][here]]. Here's a tidbit:

Brandon: In regards to your first printed game, Go Fish Fitness, how long did it take you to make it?

Garret: From concept to fulfillment, 10 monthsâ€¦

- 1 month to finalize the initial design and prototype
- 2 weeks to contact and come to an agreement with an artist
- 1 month of vacation (he was on vacation, my wife and I were welcoming our most recent child into the world)
- 2.5 months to complete and finalize the artwork
- 1.5 months to prepare the print files, finalize the box art, and print sample production copies
- 1 month to prepare for the Kickstarter.
- 1 month to run the Kickstarter.
- 1.5 months to manufacture and distribute

Take Away:

- Share your idea
- Show it to people! (feedback)
- playtesters!
- Work *consistently*!
- Don't worry about the first game!
  + This may mean that your first game is just an expansion or knockoff of an existing game.
  + It's good to have a portfolio demonstrating progression anyway

From the comments:
- Know why you are making the game.
  + Should we be trying to make money? Why not exactly?
