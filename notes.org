** [2021-04-10 Sat] Thoughts on Ascension: Sum to what?

I'm trying to think a little about the "feeling" of Ascension. On the one hand
it's obviously about power, influence, dominance, etc.. That's great, but I
wonder if we can also bring a little bit more subtlety and add twist. I think
connecting to history will help in this regard. Maybe you think it's about
power/influence/etc. but maybe it's also something a little deeper and a little
more timeless. It could feel somehow ineluctable in a way that points to some
deeper truth.

You could also try to communicate something about the banality of evil, perhaps?
Like what appears to be evil actually isn't. Maybe it's possible to gain by
better understanding the true motives of other characters in a way that helps
you understand where they're coming from. Maybe there's some you could model
misunderstanding and miscommunication. This starts to get at the banality aspect
of evil.

** [2021-03-19 Fri] Blockly :LIBRARY:INTERESTING:
We could consider using [[https://developers.google.com/blockly][blokcly]] as a builder interface. There's also a thin
Clojure wrapper called [[https://github.com/ParkerICI/blockoid][blockoid]]. Could use as interface for creating layouts
perhaps, if not everything. See also [[https://github.com/kloimhardt/clj-tiles][clj-tiles]] and [[https://kloimhardt.github.io/cljtiles.html?page=12][the demo]].

** [2021-03-19 Fri] Who are you doing this for :PHILOSOPHY:
I want to create a place can play simple games and talk, like
a family living room. A place where anyone can make a little game
to play with their fiends and family. A place to relax.

Chase small rewards everyday. Make sure you're solving problems at a daily rate. Never go more than a day without solving at least one problem. Recognize your limits

** [2021-03-15 Mon] Setting expectations: A timeline :RESEARCH:
There's a rambly but maybe interesting discussion [[https://brandonthegamedev.com/lets-set-expectations-time-money-effort/][here]]. Here's a tidbit:

Brandon: In regards to your first printed game, Go Fish Fitness, how long did it take you to make it?

Garret: From concept to fulfillment, 10 monthsâ€¦

- 1 month to finalize the initial design and prototype
- 2 weeks to contact and come to an agreement with an artist
- 1 month of vacation (he was on vacation, my wife and I were welcoming our most recent child into the world)
- 2.5 months to complete and finalize the artwork
- 1.5 months to prepare the print files, finalize the box art, and print sample production copies
- 1 month to prepare for the Kickstarter.
- 1 month to run the Kickstarter.
- 1.5 months to manufacture and distribute

- Core Engine: minimum et of rules.
- Mechanics: Constraints that create obstacles.
- Rules: Regulate how mechanics are implemented (???) Meta mechanics? Principles?
- Internal Narrative: rags to riches, etc.
- External Narrative: sales pitch.

Take Away:

- Share your idea
- Show it to people! (feedback)
- playtesters!
- Work *consistently*!
- Don't worry about the first game!
  + This may mean that your first game is just an expansion or knockoff of an existing game.
  + It's good to have a portfolio demonstrating progression anyway

From the comments:
- Know why you are making the game.
  + Should we be trying to make money? Why not exactly?
