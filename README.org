* Installing
I think it will be highly beneficial for use share a container for development.
This will:

- Make development much smoother because we have a shared environment.
- Emacs generally runs much better on Linux.
- Great way to dip your toes into the Linux world.
- Simplifies deployment because many hosting services support docker
  containers directly.

** Windows
I won't be able to say exactly how to install on Window since I don't have it,
but following these guides should get you there:

1. Install doom emacs following this [[https://earvingad.github.io/posts/doom_emacs_windows/][guide]].
2. [[https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/][Install Docker]]
3. Try running emacs in a Linux docker container following [[https://github.com/JAremko/docker-emacs#windows][this guide]]. You'll want
   to make sure you also bind-mount your `.emacs.d` into the container for doom to
   work properly.
