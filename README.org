* Installing
I think it will be highly beneficial to use a shared container for development.
This will:

- Make development much smoother because we have a shared environment.
- Emacs generally runs much better on Linux.
- Great way to dip your toes into the Linux world.
- Simplifies deployment because many hosting services support docker
  containers directly.
* Clone this repo:
- install git

- `git clone git@github.com:cartesian-theatrics/games.git --recursive`. This will probably
  fail. You'll need to generate an ssh key [[https://github.com/settings/keys][here]] (notice the link to "generating SSH keys").
  Generally it's worth going through the trouble to setup ssh keys, otherwise you'll constantly
  be authenticating manually and some things won't work as smoothly. You'll want to make sure you
  install `openssh` in Cygwin and use something like `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<email>"`.
** Windows
I won't be able to say exactly how to install on Window since I don't have it,
but following these guides should get you there:

1. [[https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/][Install Docker]]
2. If you want, install Doom Emacs following this [[https://earvingad.github.io/posts/doom_emacs_windows/][guide]]. Note, this repo includes Doom Emacs
   which should work with the docker container for development.
3. Try running emacs in a Linux docker container following [[https://github.com/JAremko/docker-emacs#windows][this guide]]. You'll want
   to make sure you also bind-mount your `.emacs.d` into the container for doom to
   work properly. See my docker_run.sh script.
4. Create copy of docker_run.sh and see if you can get it to work with Cygwin.
* Development
** Colaborative editing
We'll use crdt.el for collaborative editing. It's designed for
org-mode and allows you to share any emacs buffer for collaborative
editing. See the README [[https://code.librehq.com/qhong/crdt.el][here]]. The docker container is already
setup with `tuntox`, so follow the guide for that to share your buffers.

I'll make sure that CRDT is supported out-of-the-box as I setup the emacs
environment here. I've tested it already with two computers and it works
wonderfully.
