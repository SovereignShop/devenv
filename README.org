* Installing
** Windows
- [[https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-wsl2-windows-10][Install]] WSL 2.
- [[https://linoxide.com/how-install-ubuntu-windows-10/#:~:text=%20Install%20Ubuntu%20on%20Windows%2010%20WSL%202,Linux%20kernel%20update%20package%20and%20double...%20More][Install Ubuntu]] with WSL 2.
- Install [[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop][Docker Desktop]] for Windows.
- Enable WSL 2 engine in docker: go to settings and toggle "Use the WSL 2 based engine".
- Restart docker.
- Install [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/][vcxsrv]] using windows.
- Create a shortcut to launch cvxsrv on your desktop:
  + Right Click -> new -> shortcut.
  + past this in the "location" field: ~"C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\vcxsrv.exe" :0 -ac -terminate -lesspointer -multiwindow -clipboard -wgl -ac -dpi auto~
  + Save shortcut
- Launch CvSxrv by double clicking the X icon. You should see it show up in your running programs panel.
- Login into ubuntu.
- Install terminator: ~sudo apt install terminator~
- Launch terminator by just invoking the command at the prompt. You should see a new terminal window show up. If you get this far,
  it means your X window server is working.
- Install some programs:
  + zsh & git: ~sudo apt install zsh git~
  + oh-my-zsh: =sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"=
- Launch into zsh terminal.
- Configure git: src_python{git config --global user.email "<your email here>" && git config --global user.name "<your name here>"}
- Create an ssh-key:
  + =ssh-keygen -C "<email>"= (default all the options)
  + Cat the public key: ~cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub~
  + Copy/Paste your public key into github. See [[https://github.com/settings/keys][here]], click "New SSH key".
- Create ssh session: ~eval `ssh-agent` && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa~
- Clone the repo: ~git clone git@github.com:cartesian-theatrics/games.git --recursive~
  + NOTE: make sure you've accepted all three of my github collaboration invites before cloning. You need
    to be a collaborator on all the repos.
- Build docker container: ~./docker_build.sh~ (this will take a long time the first time)
- Run docker container: ~./docker_run_windows.sh~ (this will also take a long time the first time)
** Linux
Once you have docker installed, Simply run:
1. ./docker_build.sh (in this directory)
2. ./docker_run.sh (in this directory)
* Development
** Colaborative editing
We'll use crdt.el for collaborative editing. It's designed for
org-mode and allows you to share any emacs buffer for collaborative
editing. See the README [[https://code.librehq.com/qhong/crdt.el][here]]. The docker container is already
setup with `tuntox`, so follow the guide for that to share your buffers.

I'll make sure that CRDT is supported out-of-the-box as I setup the emacs
environment here. I've tested it already with two computers and it works
wonderfully.
** Communication
I installed telegram into the container with voice support so we should be able to
chat to each other directly in emacs. You'll want to install telegram for your
desktop: https://desktop.telegram.org/

Just run ~M-x telega~ (say yes to the compile questions) to connect the emacs
client to your telegram desktop.
